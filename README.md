Windows Privilege Escalation

Intro:
Gaining unauthorized access to your windows and gaining more control than what is typically allowed. It is possible due to weakness or vulnerability in the system.

Example - Login to website with someone's account

2 types:

1.Horizontal priv escalation - When 1st users got access to other account via any username or password or via any other method and login or work as 2nd user.

2.Vertical priv escalation - When user able to perform any activity on behalf of administrator.

I Gaining Initial Access 

->It basically requires some type of privilages in your hand.
->Once we have initial access we can then perform enumeration to identify vulnerabilities that can allow us to do privilage escalation.
